<h1>Moss Test</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    Upload the zip/rar/tar file you uploaded to OurVLE for the assignment here, <strong>EXACTLY AS YOU UPLOADED IT.</strong>
    I will run a moss comparison and see where the similarities are, so we can know what we're getting into with Dr. Fokum.
    Obviously, don't send this to Fokum.
